Every single ingredient - from the bread to the onions and tomatoes, the lamb and the sauce - was delicious. These four stars are well deserved because of the tasty sandwich and great ambiance. \\xa0I would recommend this place to anyone.\",\n",

I definitely plan on going back for dinner. \\xa0If the small space doesn\\'t suit you their sister restaurant Snack Taverna in the West Village is just as good, if not better...and more \"upscale\" with waiters who make you feel well taken care of.']"
